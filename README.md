# [Submitted] The WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge

#### Did you use any content you do not have ownership rights to?

Yes, I don’t have ownership of the sounds effects, endangered animals list and fish description.

1. Sounds Effects: I used sounds that are free for commercial and non-commercial projects. That sounds includes background, buttons tap, wrong tap, feeding effects. I really want to thanks the Mixkit and Chosic for the sounds;
2. List of endangered animals: The list was prepared by the National Biodiversity Commission (Conabio). Conabio is a permanent inter-ministerial commission of the Federal Brazil government;
3. Fish descriptions: The descriptive texts of the fish were taken mostly from Wikipedia, but also from Austrolebias cinereus, (Amato, 1986) and New species of the genus Leporinus Agassiz.

#### Tell us about the features and technologies you used in your app project

In Brazil, we see a significant increase in endangered animals. In 2014, the number of endangered animal species was 698, today, 1,399, unfortunately doubled in 8 years. Many of the animals that were on the list in 2014 remain on the list, meaning little effective action has been taken to reverse the situation.

In the future, I want to live on a sailboat, one of the big reasons for this is that I want to know the depths of the oceans and its marine life, but I am apprehensive that many of the species that are threatened today, will be extinct or not be free. when that moment comes. Therefore, this game tries to make people aware of the environmental problems that affect marine animals in Brazil, teaching that our attitudes, even if small, help to save marine life.

You will be responsible for saving the fish that are in danger in the ocean, and putting them in aquariums (this is the last action before an animal goes extinct), doing this, also comes the responsibility of feeding these fish. The animals that remain in the ocean can still suffer from human attitudes, such as pollution and chemical spills (such as oil, fertilizers, etc…) so you will have to fight these problems for the fish to survive.

To implement the features above, these frameworks/techniques are used:

Math: The fish move in a simple parametric curve using two anchor points, one above the starting point, and one below;
Shapes and Animations: The sea waves and the sand are a curved line that have an animation for the movement effect;
GeometryEffect: Some transitions use the GeometryEffect to move a View from one position to another;
AVFAudio: All iterations with the sounds are done through AVFAudio;
MVVC and Protocol Extensions: The project's architecture was based on MVVC, and the development made heavy use of protocol extensions, to facilitate the creation of new functionality and project scalability;
Vectornator and GIMP: The fish images, background, buttons, icon and plants were created by Vectornator and GIMP.

#### If you've shared or considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others, let us know

I love computer science and I love sharing knowledge. I really like a quote by Newton about this, he once said: “If I have been able to see further, it is only because I stood on the shoulders of giants”.

In my first year of college, I had the opportunity to help my computer science professor in a course for seniors, people who had little or no knowledge of technology. This course showed me how technology has changed people's lives and how it is essential for everyone today, many of the students on the course were over 60, 70, 80 years old, and they all had one thing in common, they were curious. Curiosity is the great ally of everyone who loves technology.

In addition, I also love to share knowledge by developing projects in my spare time. Once I helped to develop a co-funded by the Erasmus+ Program of the European Union to facilitate the exchanges between schools across Europe and make more common and usual teaching and learning by having an international approach. This project emerged precisely to facilitate the union of knowledge that is dispersed throughout society, especially among schools.

For the same reason, to share knowledge about environmental issues that affect marine life, I chose the topic for this Swift Student Challenge. I hope this game helps people to realize how small personal attitudes, united with other people, generate a big result.

Lastly, I would like to talk about the events that happened for me to be here today. My connection to Apple started in 2017, when I installed Hackintosh on my laptop (I know this is wrong, but at the time I didn't have the money to buy the official products, sorry). Not all macOS features worked, but this was the best way to get close to this amazing operating system. In 2020, I was already using a MacBook, but not yet developing with Swift. A little over a year and a half later, a combination of factors happened that changed my life: I had just bought an iPhone and I had just read Steve Jobs' biography. The iPhone showed me how things worked incredibly well, they had a certain magic, the way everything worked was surprising and inspiring, and the biography showed me that we can change the world for the better, that we can create things we could never have imagined that one day. could exist, that all our actions can have a positive impact on people's lives and change the way things happen. And so, 4 months ago, I quit my job to learn Swift and create apps that can change people's lives too.
