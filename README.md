#### Did you use any content you do not have ownership rights to?

Yes, I don’t have ownership of the sounds effects, endangered animals list, and fish descriptions. All content is under the respective licensing terms and copyright obligations.

1. Sounds Effects: I used sounds that can be used without attribution. That sounds include background, buttons tap, wrong tap, and feeding effect.
2. List of endangered animals: The list was prepared by the National Biodiversity Commission (Conabio). Conabio is a permanent inter-ministerial commission of the Federal Brazil government;
3. Fish descriptions: The descriptive texts of the fish were taken mostly from Wikipedia, but also from Austrolebias cinereus, (Amato, 1986) and New species of the genus Leporinus Agassiz.

#### Tell us about the features and technologies you used in your app project

In Brazil, we see a significant increase in endangered animals. In 2014, the number of endangered animal species was 698, today, 1,399, unfortunately, doubled in 8 years. Many of the animals that were on the list in 2014 remain on the list, meaning little effective action has been taken to reverse the situation.

In the future, I want to live on a sailboat, one of the big reasons for this is that I want to know the depths of the oceans and their marine life, but I am apprehensive that many of the species that are threatened today, will be extinct or not be free when that moment comes. Therefore, this app tries to make people aware of the environmental problems that affect marine animals in Brazil and the world, teaching that our attitudes, even if small, help to save marine life.

You will be responsible for saving the fish that are in danger in the ocean, and putting them in aquariums (this is the last action before an animal goes extinct), doing this, also comes with the responsibility of feeding these fish. The animals that remain in the ocean can still suffer from human attitudes, such as pollution and chemical spills (such as oil, fertilizers…) so you will have to fight these problems for the fish to survive.

To implement the features above, these frameworks/techniques are used:

1. Math: The fish move in a simple parametric curve using two anchor points, one above the starting point, and one below;
2. Shapes and Animations: The sea waves and the sand are a curved line that has an animation for the movement effect;
3. GeometryEffect: Some transitions use the GeometryEffect to move a View from one position to another;
4. Core Haptics: To create the vibration when an invalid option is pressed;
5. AVFAudio: All iterations with the sounds are done through AVFAudio;
6. MVVC and extension-oriented design: The project's architecture was based on MVVC and the development was made using extension-oriented design;
7. Vectornator and GIMP: All images (fish, background, buttons, icon, plants) were created by Vectornator and GIMP.

#### If you've shared or considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others, let us know

I love computer science and I love sharing knowledge. I like a quote by Newton about this, he once said: “If I have been able to see further, it is only because I stood on the shoulders of giants”.

In my first year of college, I had the opportunity to help my computer science professor in a course for seniors, people who had little or no knowledge of technology. This course showed me how technology has changed people's lives and how it is essential for everyone today, many of the students on the course were over 60, 70, and 80 years old, and they all had one thing in common, they were curious. Curiosity is the great ally of everyone who loves technology.

In addition, I also love to share knowledge by developing projects in my spare time. Once I helped to develop a co-funded by the Erasmus+ Program of the European Union to facilitate the exchanges between schools across Europe and make more common and usual teaching and learning by having an international approach. This project emerged precisely to facilitate the union of knowledge that is dispersed throughout society, especially in schools.

For the same reason, to share knowledge about environmental issues that affect marine life, I chose the topic for this Swift Student Challenge. I hope this app helps people to realize how small personal attitudes, united with other people, generate a big result, and can change the world.

#### Is there anything else you would like us to know?

I'm not sure I answered "Which software should we use to run your application project?" correctly. This app was created by "Swift Playground App" in Xcode, but the target is iPhones and iPads.
